# Network Connectivity Troubleshooting

## Overview
This repository documents a basic network connectivity troubleshooting exercise commonly performed in IT help desk and entry-level support roles. The focus of this project is validating network connectivity using ICMP and testing access behavior related to MAC addressing.

## Scenario
A user experienced limited network connectivity. Initial indicators suggested the device was connected to the network but was unable to access required resources.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- ICMP testing (ping)
- Network interface configuration
- MAC address modification (spoofing)
- Operating System networking utilities

## Troubleshooting Process
1. Verified network reachability by sending ICMP echo requests (ping) to confirm basic connectivity.
2. Analyzed network behavior to determine whether access restrictions were present.
3. Temporarily modified the MAC address to test connectivity behavior under a different network identity.
4. Confirmed successful network access after testing.
5. Restored the original MAC address and verified stable connectivity.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network connectivity testing and validation
- Understanding of MAC-based network access behavior
- Basic Layer 2 troubleshooting concepts
- Problem isolation and resolution
- Clear documentation of troubleshooting steps

## Outcome
Network connectivity was successfully tested and validated. The exercise demonstrated how MAC address behavior can impact access to network resources and reinforced foundational troubleshooting techniques used in IT support environments.
